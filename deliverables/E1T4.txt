Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The first poor practice that we can see in the diagram is deploying the
"Web Service Instance" directly in the Public Subnet. By doing this, everyone
in the Internet can access directly to the Instance.
=> To prevent this poor practice,we can deploy it to the Private Subnet and then
use the Public NAT Gateway,so that the Instance in private subnets can connect
to the internet and userfrom the Internet can not connect directly to the Instance.

# Poor practice 2
The second poor practice that we can see in the diagram is the S3 bucket policy is
not follow "least privilege" principle. As we can see in the "InstanceRolePolicy-C3",
it allows all action in any S3 resources, which means with this policy,
the Web Service Instance can access to the Free Recipes and Secret Recipes.
=> To prevent this poor practice, we can change the policy for the Web Service Instance
to only allow get action in Free Recipes bucket. With this policy, even if the
attackers can get the credential to access to S3 service, they will only get
the objects in the Free Recipes bucket and the Secret Recipes bucket will be unharmed.
