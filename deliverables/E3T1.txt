# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
 - After I run "hydra" about 1 hour but still AWS GuardDuty show "You don't have any findings." so I just can not answer this question.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
 - What I found in AWS document:
  * "Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors and analyzes your AWS account and workload event data found in AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs"
  * "Activity suggesting reconnaissance by an attacker, such as unusual API activity, suspicious database login attempts, intra-VPC port scanning, unusual failed login request patterns, or unblocked port probing from a known bad IP."
 => So based on the document, I think that AWS will scan the DNS Logs and compare with some signature rule that can detect the scan port attack in a period of time, then if there is a matching result, AWS Guard Duty will capture and alert to the user.
