# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
 - We can disable the ssh connection by restricted port 22 and also stop/remove "sshd" service in the instance (because with this service running it will be established the ssh connection from client to server.
 - Instead of launching the instance in the public subnet, we can launch it in the private subnet, and then we can allow the ssh connection only from specific public subnet in the VPC.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
 - We can change the policy "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" to allow only S3 get object action in only "Free Recipes" bucket. In this case, even if the API credentials were compromised, the "Secret Recipes" bucket will remain unharmed.
