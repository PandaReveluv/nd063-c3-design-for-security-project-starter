Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

From AWS Config
 - We have "securityhub-nacl-no-unrestricted-ssh-rdp-67edc95a" which said that the NACL is not restricted port 22 (ssh) and 3389 (rdp). This NACL is currently used by public subnet for WebServiceInstance, which mean we can access to these 2 ports from the Internet directly to the WebServiceInstance.
 => Recommendations: we should only open the port that the WebServiceInstance is using (like 80 for http or 443 for https) and restricted all other ports if not needed ("least privilege" principle), and always restricted access to port 22 and 3389 because the attacker can do the remote code execution attack by using these 2 ports.

From AWS Security Hub
 * CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0
  - We have "Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22" which said that the Security Group is allow all connect to port 22 (ssh), and this Security Group is currently used by "Web Service Instance - C3" instance so everyone from the Internet can access to port 22 of this instance.
  => Recommendations: we should only open the port that the "Web Service Instance - C3" is using (like 80 for http or 443 for https) and restricted all other ports if not needed ("least privilege" principle), and always restricted access to port 22 and 3389 because the attacker can do the remote code execution attack by using these 2 ports.
 * AWS Foundational Security Best Practices v1.0.0
  - We have "S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer" which said that we should connect to S3 bucket through HTTPS (SSL). Currently, the 2 buckets "Free Recipes" and "Secret Recipes" is not using SSL connection, so the transit is not secured.
  => Recommendations: we can add policy to deny all connect not using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

From Amazon Inspector
 - We have "On instance i-00f94d4631f2deb57, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet" which said that the instance is running "sshd" service for listening incoming ssh connection and also reachable from the internet (allow port 22).
 => Recommendations: we should only open the port that the instance is using (like 80 for http or 443 for https) and restricted all other ports if not needed ("least privilege" principle), and always restricted access to port 22 and 3389 because the attacker can do the remote code execution attack by using these 2 ports. We also should not run any service that is not needed like "sshd" because without it, even if the connection is established with port 22, the instance still remains unharmed.
